# IC---Software-Analytcs

In this repository we present an approach to enhance the investigation regarding the level of adoption of CI/CD practices in software repositories hosted on GitHub. For that, we developed a tool to mine data related to the concrete structure of CI/CD pipelines and their executions, exploring the potential of the valuable data available in GitHub Actions.

The demo video for the tool is at: https://youtu.be/Y306o-VjA0c}{https://youtu.be/Y306o-VjA0c

The Research is supported by CNPQ and Unicamp.
